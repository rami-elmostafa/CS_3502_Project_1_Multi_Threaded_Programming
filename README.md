## Introduction
This project was created in an Operating Systems course to provide real-world scenarios and techniques, specifically focusing on multi-threading and interprocess communication (IPC).  

### Objectives:
- Develop a multi-threaded application using a language capable of accessing unsafe memory and “true” threading.
- Demonstrate IPC through pipe (`|`) implementation to showcase data communication.
- Utilize a Linux-based development environment, a LaTeX-based report, and a demonstration video.
